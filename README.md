Classic Cardivascular Magnetic Resonance takes a long time to obtain images over multiple hear bearts. Real time CMR is 
faster but the data acquired is often of low spatial and temporal resolution. In this project, three CNN are used to 
produce MRI image reconstruction, namely, UNet3D, UNet2D1D, and UNet2D2D.  The configuration file training_config.yaml 
allows users to configure the training tasks and the hyperparameters in the network.
